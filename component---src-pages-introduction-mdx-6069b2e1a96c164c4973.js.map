Western notation and Western harmony have both followed this arc. I believe that the DAW is entering phase 3, and artists are grasping for new means of expression as their traditional tools fail them. Functional programming (or \"FP\") helps break out of the current dominant paradigm, providing a collection of powerful ideas that allow artists to create radically new work. I hope that, by the end of our time together, you'll feel empowered to use FP in your own artistic creations.`}</p>\n    <h2>{`The journey ahead`}</h2>\n    <p>{`Over the next few lessons, we'll go over concepts like rhythms, functors, chords, products, improvisation, co-ends, mysticism and dependent types. The goal will be to use music to strengthen our intuition about functional programming and to use functional programming to strengthen our intuition about music.`}</p>\n    <p>{`During this journey, we will frequently make use of our fingers to edit code and our ears to listen. Our basic interface will be an editor pane like the one below.

When I started out on my journey through FP, concepts like the `}<a parentName=\"p\" {...{\n        \"href\": \"https://pursuit.purescript.org/packages/purescript-prelude/5.0.1/docs/Data.Functor#t:Functor\"\n      }}>{`functor`}</a>{` and the `}<a parentName=\"p\" {...{\n        \"href\": \"https://pursuit.purescript.org/packages/purescript-prelude/5.0.1/docs/Control.Semigroupoid#t:Semigroupoid\"\n      }}>{`semigroupoid`}</a>{` were so overwhelming that I almost gave up. Music proved to be the path that helped me truly understand functional programming, and inversely, functional programming changed the way I looked at music. As you make your way through these articles, I hope that one domain always reinforces the other, helping you become more creative musicians and programmers.`}</p>\n    <p>{`Lastly, a bit of housekeeping. All you need is a browser to follow along, play the audio examples, and edit them. However, at a certain point, you may want to experiment on your local machine or jam with others on a shared server. At the end of every article, including this one, there will be links to more resources about PureScript, music making in the browser, and functional programming in general.`}</p>\n    <Next next={\"./note-function\"} mdxType=\"Next\" />\n    <Footer mdxType=\"Footer\" />\n\n    </MDXLayout>;\n}\n;\nMDXContent.isMDXComponent = true;\n      "],"names":["_frontmatter","layoutProps","MDXContent","components","props","mdxType","player","introMain","code","intro","parentName","icon","faPlayCircle","singleNoteMain","singleNote","faStopCircle","preload","complexPatternMain","complexPattern","next","isMDXComponent"],"sourceRoot":""}
