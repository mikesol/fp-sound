Disparate forces combine together to create something beautiful and magical, and then they dissipate. The forces themselves, however, are eternal. An arm exists before and after it drags a bow across a cello string, and the arm itself is composed of matter and forces that predate and will post-date the human to whom the arm belongs as the cello string is being played.

The possible, when made actual, always terminates at some point. It may terminate in a way that we're not happy with (by resulting in an exception, for example). But time does not end, nor do the physical forces that translate into human gestures, some of which are uniquely applied to the making of and listening to music.
