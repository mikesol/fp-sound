# yap.wags.fm

Hi! This page provides the essential documentation for yap.wags.fm.

## Formats

yap.wags.fm currently accepts two formats:

### Text

The text format, which is in the starter document, consists of mini-notation. Here's an example:

```
bd bd hh chin*4
# @duration 0.8
```

A big thanks to whoever wrote [the Tidal documentation](http://tidalcycles.org/docs/reference/mini_notation/), which was dutifully copied below.

| Symbol | Description                              | Example                               |
|--------|------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------|
| `hh27` | A single note.                           | `bassdm hh27 bassdm hh27`             |
| `~`    | A rest.                                  | `bassdm ~ bassdm hh27`                |
| `[ ]`  | Create a pattern grouping.               | `[bassdm kick] hh27`                  |
| `,`    | Play multiple patterns at the same time. | `bassdm hh27 , cr cr cr cr`           |
| `< >`  | Alternate between patterns.              | `[hh hh hh] [hh27 gab hh27 <gab cr>]` |

All lines starting with a `#` are ignored except in the following cases:

- To set the duration of the cycle to a number (ie 4.2 seconds), write `# @duration 4.2`. This number **must** be a float, meaning it must have a decimal part, even if that part is 0. Only positive numbers are allowed.

### PureScript

You can copy any wags document into the editor and it should "just work."" Check out this <Link to={"../crash-course"}>crash course</Link> to learn more about `wags` syntax. To whet your appetite, a playable and editable example is below! Anything from that crash course or from this [cookbook](https://github.com/mikesol/wagsi/tree/main/cookbook) is fair game.

For more complex synthesis, use this notation at the expense of reactivity (it takes a couple more cycles to update). Also, on mobile devices, PureScript mode can be a bit janky (I'm working to fix this).

## Yap?

Why the name yap.wags.fm?

- To yap means to be vociferous... loquacious... prolix... which is what you should do on yap.wags.fm!
- A buddy of mine and investor in my company Jeremy Yap saw a demo of wags (the library powering this site) tech and said "yeah but can it auto-update in real time?" I showed him a couple demos using VSCode, but they felt cumbersome. So this is my actual answer.
