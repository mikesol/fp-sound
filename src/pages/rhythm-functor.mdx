# The rhythm and the functor

Rhythm transports humans and functors transport categories. This is why my second post is on the rhythm and the functor. By the end of this post, I want you to _hear_ the rhythm of functors and allow them to take your music to new places.

### Rhythm

Everything we perceive as rhythm boils down to a series of unaccented and accented moments in time. The accents, or agogics, are a mix of volume, timbre and harmony.

Great rhythms have a delicate mix of symmetry and asymettry that deeply moves us. Some of this is certainly culturally delimited, stemming from the use of certain instruments or voices or pitch languages. Other aspects of rhythm's power feels more intrinsic. When we catch ourselves being moved by the rhythm of a forest or of a machine, we struggle to explain why, and that's of course ok. Rhythm defies explanation in ways big and small - the ancient Stoics elevated it to the status of the cosmos, and Kant likened it with the most intimate of beliefs. In both cases, rhythm finds us and takes us elsewhere, be it on an internal or external journey.

Like many things in music, rhythm often exists as a conversation with the past, taking the old and creativly deforming it into something new. One of my favorite examples of this is JAY-Z's _Show Me What you Got_.

I could go on forever about why I love this rhythm. Some reasons probably include:

But at the end of the day when I'm listening to it I don't think about any of these things: I just love it.

Over the course of this article, we're going to be unpacking and remixing lots of rhythms. I'll start here, with a short remix of JAY-Z that takes his rhythm as a point of departure and pushes it somewhere new.
