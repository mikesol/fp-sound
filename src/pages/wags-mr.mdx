# Wags MR

Wags MR is a mixed-reality platform that DJs around the world use to collaborate on live sets.

## How it works

A DJ anchors a live set in a venue and, at the same time, DJs from aronud the world watch the crowd on a live feed and help shape the music. We do this by communicating music through **code** using [mini-notation](http://tidalcycles.org/docs/reference/mini_notation/), a format popularized by Tidal Cycles.

We run monthly jam sessions on Discord where DJs and listeners from over 10 countries tune into our sets.

Our platform runs in the browser, allowing DJs to collaborate on musical sets the same way that designers collaborate on Figma.

<Player preload player={exampleMain} code={example} />

When you click or press <FontAwesomeIcon icon={faPlayCircle} />, the code you hear is rendered live in your browser. Press <FontAwesomeIcon icon={faStopCircle} /> and change the code a bit. For example, you can change `bass:1` to `bass:1*4` to create a rebound effect. Then, press <FontAwesomeIcon icon={faPlayCircle} /> again.

Wags MR can host up to 100 DJs collaborating in real-time on auto-updating documents.

## 2022 Tour

As the world opens up again, we are taking our online jams to clubs around the world, starting in **Florida, USA** in **May 2022**. We are planning a European tour in Fall 2022 and would love to talk to you about bringing our mixed-reality jam session to your venue.

### What's in it for you?

- International exposure and PR as DJs around the world collaborate on a set in _your_ venue.
- A live stream of the set that auto-updates online, allowing folks around the world to discover your brand and make your club a priority destination on their next trip.
- A novel way to engage your patrons, as they will also be able to collaborate on the music directly from their phones and watches as the set evolves (try opening this page on mobile and playing/editing the example above - it will work flawlessly).
