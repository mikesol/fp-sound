The program starts by defining a `}<strong parentName=\"p\">{`module`}</strong>{`. By calling this module `}<inlineCode parentName=\"p\">{`Main`}</inlineCode>{`, we're telling the compiler that this is where the main action of our program resides. This is followed by a series of `}<inlineCode parentName=\"p\">{`import`}</inlineCode>{` statements declaring what types and terms we'll use from other libraries (I'll define \"type\" and \"term\" below). Lastly, the actual program called `}<inlineCode parentName=\"p\">{`main`}</inlineCode>{` exists on two levels: the type-level (its type is `}<inlineCode parentName=\"p\">{`Player`}</inlineCode>{`) and on the term-level (its terms are `}<inlineCode parentName=\"p\">{`play`}</inlineCode>{` and `}<inlineCode parentName=\"p\">{`c4`}</inlineCode>{`). This distinction between, and eventually interplay of, types and terms will be crucial to our reasoning about music and functional programs.`}</p>\n    <h2>{`Types and terms`}</h2>\n    <p>{`Functional programs contain two basic units of composition: `}<em parentName=\"p\">{`types`}</em>{` and `}<em parentName=\"p\">{`terms`}</em>{`. These units form the basis of a play staring three core protagonists: you, a compiler, and a computer. A `}<em parentName=\"p\">{`term`}</em>{` points to some chunk of memory on a computer that stores an opaque series of bytes. We give the term a name like `}<inlineCode parentName=\"p\">{`c4`}</inlineCode>{` or `}<inlineCode parentName=\"p\">{`play`}</inlineCode>{` to indicate to other readers what it `}<em parentName=\"p\">{`is`}</em>{` or `}<em parentName=\"p\">{`does`}</em>{`. A `}<em parentName=\"p\">{`type`}</em>{` is an assertion to the compiler about how a term can be used in a program. Types have names like `}<inlineCode parentName=\"p\">{`Player`}</inlineCode>{`. When the compiler receives an assertion in the form of a type, it can either accept the assertion, reject it, or punt until it receives more information. In our program above, the compiler `}<em parentName=\"p\">{`accepts`}</em>{` the assertion that `}<inlineCode parentName=\"p\">{`play c4`}</inlineCode>{` has the type `}<inlineCode parentName=\"p\">{`Player`}</inlineCode>{`. When all the assertions in a program are accepted, we say a program compiles, and the compiler sends the program off to the computer to do something interesting like render it to your screen, play it through your loudspeakers, or save it for a rainy day.`}</p>\n    <p>{`Let's revisit the program above:`}</p>\n    <Player player={singleNoteMain} code={singleNote} mdxType=\"Player\" />\n    <p>{`It contains one type assertion - that `}<inlineCode parentName=\"p\">{`main`}</inlineCode>{` is `}<inlineCode parentName=\"p\">{`Player`}</inlineCode>{` - and three terms:`}</p>\n    <ul>\n      <li parentName=\"ul\"><inlineCode parentName=\"li\">{`main`}</inlineCode>{`, whose type is asserted to be `}<inlineCode parentName=\"li\">{`Player`}</inlineCode>{`;`}</li>\n      <li parentName=\"ul\"><inlineCode parentName=\"li\">{`play`}</inlineCode>{`, whose type is `}<inlineCode parentName=\"li\">{`Function Pitch Player`}</inlineCode>{`; and`}</li>\n      <li parentName=\"ul\"><inlineCode parentName=\"li\">{`c4`}</inlineCode>{`, whose type is `}<inlineCode parentName=\"li\">{`Pitch`}</inlineCode>{`.`}</li>\n    </ul>\n    <p>{`Often times, when talking about functions, we'll use an infix notation of a right-pointing arrow `}<inlineCode parentName=\"p\">{`->`}</inlineCode>{`. So, `}<inlineCode parentName=\"p\">{`play`}</inlineCode>{` can be rewritten as `}<inlineCode parentName=\"p\">{`Pitch -> Player`}</inlineCode>{`.`}</p>\n    <p>{`When the compiler compiles the program, it treats every function as an `}<em parentName=\"p\">{`if/then`}</em>{` proposition and makes sure that we've provided enough evidence to prove this proposition. In the case above, `}<inlineCode parentName=\"p\">{`play`}</inlineCode>{` is a proposition saying \"If you give me a `}<inlineCode parentName=\"p\">{`Pitch`}</inlineCode>{`, I'll give you a term of type `}<inlineCode parentName=\"p\">{`Player`}</inlineCode>{`\". In the program, `}<inlineCode parentName=\"p\">{`c4`}</inlineCode>{` is `}<em parentName=\"p\">{`evidence`}</em>{` to play (we can also call it an argument to `}<inlineCode parentName=\"p\">{`play`}</inlineCode>{` or `}<inlineCode parentName=\"p\">{`play`}</inlineCode>{`'s input). Evidence to propositions, or equivalently arguments to functions, act like keys to a lock. The term `}<inlineCode parentName=\"p\">{`c4`}</inlineCode>{` of type `}<inlineCode parentName=\"p\">{`Pitch`}</inlineCode>{` unlocks the proposition `}<inlineCode parentName=\"p\">{`Pitch -> Player`}</inlineCode>{`, producing an `}<inlineCode parentName=\"p\">{`Player`}</inlineCode>{`.

For example, if we want to add the result of an LFO to the result of a terraced function, we would write something like `}<inlineCode parentName=\"p\">{`(\\\\t -> lfo t + terraced t)`}</inlineCode>{`. While this is fine in small doses, it gets tedious if `}<em parentName=\"p\">{`everything`}</em>{` is a function of time. We'd like to somehow abstract away time so that we never directly have to deal with it. In functional programming, there are many ways to do this, including the `}<inlineCode parentName=\"p\">{`Reader`}</inlineCode>{` pattern (treating time as an environment) and the `}<inlineCode parentName=\"p\">{`Behavior`}</inlineCode>{` pattern (representing functions of time as a separate type). We'll see both of those in a later article, but what I'd like to show here is how to accomplish this using functors and applicatives.`}</p>\n    <p>{`The example above, using the Functor operation `}<inlineCode parentName=\"p\">{`<$>`}</inlineCode>{` and the Applicative operation `}<inlineCode parentName=\"p\">{`<*>`}</inlineCode>{`, can be written as `}<inlineCode parentName=\"p\">{`add <$> lfo <*> terraced`}</inlineCode>{`.

So, rather than applying it directly, let's store its arguments in a free structure (an Array, also known as a \"free monoid\") and then interpret it using a simple interpreter called `}<inlineCode parentName=\"p\">{`foldl`}</inlineCode>{` that applies a function (in this case, `}<inlineCode parentName=\"p\">{`compose`}</inlineCode>{`) to the arguments starting from an initial argument.`}</p>\n    <p><strong parentName=\"p\">{`example`}</strong></p>\n    <h2>{`Music`}</h2>\n    <p>{`Already, just using this technique, we can make some wicked one-note beats that give the one-note samba a run for its money! Below, I've written three functions - `}<inlineCode parentName=\"p\">{`f0`}</inlineCode>{`, `}<inlineCode parentName=\"p\">{`f1`}</inlineCode>{` and `}<inlineCode parentName=\"p\">{`f2`}</inlineCode>{` - each of which create a one-note piece. The one currently slotted to play is called `}<inlineCode parentName=\"p\">{`f0`}</inlineCode>{`. Go ahead and substitute in and out different functions. Tweak them. Compose them. If you're up to it, try using `}<inlineCode parentName=\"p\">{`<$>`}</inlineCode>{`, `}<inlineCode parentName=\"p\">{`<*>`}</inlineCode>{` or `}<inlineCode parentName=\"p\">{`foldl`}</inlineCode>{` and see where they can take you!`}</p>\n    <p><strong parentName=\"p\">{`example`}</strong></p>\n    <h2>{`Scales`}</h2>\n    <p>{`Armed with our composition skills, we can approach pitch in the same way that we approached volume.  Before we do, though, it'd be useful to talk a bit about scales and perception of pitch and volume. While one can be plenty creative without knowing these scales, mastering them makes it easier to anticipate how music will be heard in certain cultural contexts.`}</p>\n    <p>{`In the previous example, when we were linearly changing volume between 0 and 1, the change from `}<inlineCode parentName=\"p\">{`0.0-0.5`}</inlineCode>{` felt `}<em parentName=\"p\">{`much`}</em>{` greater than the change from `}<inlineCode parentName=\"p\">{`0.5-1.0`}</inlineCode>{`. This is because, while we scaled the amplitude of the waves in the air linearly, we hear that change `}<em parentName=\"p\">{`logarithmically`}</em>{`. The unit for logarithmic amplitude is the `}<strong parentName=\"p\">{`bel`}</strong>{`, and in almsot all literature on sound, you'll hear folks talking about tenths of bels, or `}<strong parentName=\"p\">{`decibels`}</strong>{` (dB for short).  Below is a chart that shows linear increase of loudness from 0 to 1 and the corresponding change in decibels.`}</p>\n    <p><strong parentName=\"p\">{`example`}</strong></p>\n    <p>{`We can bring this even closer to human perception using `}<a parentName=\"p\" {...{\n        \"href\": \"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Equal-loudness_contour\"\n      }}>{`Fletcher-Munson curves`}</a>{`, also known as equal-loudness contours. This adds ripples into our logarithmic model that represent the ideosyncracies of human hearing. Many sensible defaults in industry-grade automatic equalization and mastering software are based on these curves.  In the examples below, we'll use a function that changes volume on a logarithmic rather than linear scale, and perhaps you will perceive it as being more smooth or gradual.`}</p>\n    <p>{`Pitch also exists on many different scales, and depending on our choice of scale, we can have radically different musical outocmes that are evokative of cultures that span the globe. When we use notes like `}<inlineCode parentName=\"p\">{`c4`}</inlineCode>{` or `}<inlineCode parentName=\"p\">{`aFlat3`}</inlineCode>{` in the examples, we are using a scale called the equally-tempered chromatic scale which became standardized in Europe in the 18th century and is currently the basis of most popular music.  The equally-tempered scale is also a logarithmic one: we perceive two pitches to be of the same class when one is a multiple of two of the other one. For example, most people hear 220.0, 440.0, 880.0 and 1760.0 as the same note shifted higher and higher.  In fact, let's let that be the basis of our first exmaple on pitch.  We'll use a function similar to the terraced function we used for volume, but we will use values that correspond to jumping octaves.`}</p>\n    <p><strong parentName=\"p\">{`example`}</strong></p>\n    <h2>{`Pitch`}</h2>\n    <p>{`All of the same functions we used to control volume can also be used to control the pitch of our single note. Let's scale them from their 0-1 range as values to a range that makes more sense for pitch. Again, we'll use composition for this.`}</p>\n    <p><strong parentName=\"p\">{`example`}</strong></p>\n    <p>{`We can also use `}<inlineCode parentName=\"p\">{`<$>`}</inlineCode>{` and `}<inlineCode parentName=\"p\">{`<*>`}</inlineCode>{` to apply binary operators to pitch, just as we did on rhythm.  Interestingly, we see that when we add an octave twice to a pitch, this has the effect of multiplying it by 4`}</p>\n    <p><strong parentName=\"p\">{`example`}</strong></p>\n    <p>{`This is because `}<inlineCode parentName=\"p\">{`Pitch`}</inlineCode>{` adheres to a different meaning of `}<inlineCode parentName=\"p\">{`add`}</inlineCode>{` and `}<inlineCode parentName=\"p\">{`mul`}</inlineCode>{` than `}<inlineCode parentName=\"p\">{`Number`}</inlineCode>{`.  In functional programming, the behavior of operators like `}<inlineCode parentName=\"p\">{`add`}</inlineCode>{` and `}<inlineCode parentName=\"p\">{`mul`}</inlineCode>{` can vary from type to type so long as they adhere to certain predefined laws. Here, addition and multiplcation are the two operators that form a `}<a parentName=\"p\" {...{\n        \"href\": \"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Semiring\"\n      }}>{`Semiring`}</a>{` and, as such, need to conform to semiring laws of being commutative over addition and distributive over multiplication. Let's test out those laws in music!`}</p>\n    <p><strong parentName=\"p\">{`example`}</strong></p>\n    <p>{`Indeed, we see that the addition of pitch commutes - `}<inlineCode parentName=\"p\">{`a + (b + c) = (a + b) + c`}</inlineCode>{`. Furthermore, multiplication distributes: `}<inlineCode parentName=\"p\">{`a * (b + c) = a * b + a * c`}</inlineCode>{`. The abiltiy to define custom behavior of functions on types based on laws is a core feature of most programming languages in the `}<a parentName=\"p\" {...{\n        \"href\": \"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ML_(programming_language)\"\n      }}>{`ML-family`}</a>{`, including `}<a parentName=\"p\" {...{\n        \"href\": \"\"\n      }}>{`Haskell`}</a>{`, `}<a parentName=\"p\" {...{\n        \"href\": \"\"\n      }}>{`Idris`}</a>{`, and the language used for these examples - `}<inlineCode parentName=\"p\">{`PureScript`}</inlineCode>{`. The fact that a single function operates differently on different types according to an underlying law is a deeply musical idea. It is the essence of a `}<em parentName=\"p\">{`theme`}</em>{` or `}<em parentName=\"p\">{`motif`}</em>{`: something that can function differently in different contexts while retaining its identity.`}</p>\n    <p>{`Getting less mathy for a bit, I'll close this section on pitch with two examples. The first will shows how to use simple data structures - in this case an array - to hold a musical score that we can play back to get a fun little Bach minuet.`}</p>\n    <p><strong parentName=\"p\">{`example`}</strong></p>\n    <p>{`The second is more abstract and experimental in nature, weaving a tapestry of pitches that brings me to a trance-like place.`}</p>\n    <p><strong parentName=\"p\">{`example`}</strong></p>\n    <p>{`In both cases, the same basic operations - functions of time - lead to different worlds, all the while keeping the rather austere constraint of a single note that can change only in pitch or volume.`}</p>\n    <h2>{`Deconstructing and reconstructing`}</h2>\n    <p>{`One of my favorite aspects about both music and functional programming is that anything can be a unit of construction or a subject of deconstruction. Often these two processes can happen at the same time. As a last exercise, and as a glimpse into the future, let's take our first `}<inlineCode parentName=\"p\">{`lfo`}</inlineCode>{` example and write it in a slightly different syntax with a different timbre. Here, instead of using one note, we'll use six. However, as the six notes will be playing at the same time, we'll hear them as a single organ-like sound.`}</p>\n    <p><strong parentName=\"p\">{`example`}</strong></p>\n    <p>{`Now, let's undercut the unity of our sound by pulling it apart over time. To do this, we'll again use `}<inlineCode parentName=\"p\">{`<$>`}</inlineCode>{` and `}<inlineCode parentName=\"p\">{`<*>`}</inlineCode>{`. And again, we'll have a whole article devoted entirely to unpacking what `}<inlineCode parentName=\"p\">{`<$>`}</inlineCode>{` and `}<inlineCode parentName=\"p\">{`<*>`}</inlineCode>{` mean - for now we can treat them as building blocks for binary operations on functions of time.`}</p>\n    <p><strong parentName=\"p\">{`example`}</strong></p>\n    <h2>{`Conclusion`}</h2>\n    <p>{`In this section, we learned how to use functional programming to shape a single note. We saw how we can compose together functions to modulate the pitch and amplitude of that note, and we saw how to compose together several notes into one larger note that decomposes and recomposes as we listen to it.
