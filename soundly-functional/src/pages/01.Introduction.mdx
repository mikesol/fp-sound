# Introduction

I use functional programming to make music. Music like:

or

All of these examples would be difficult or impossible to create using a traditional DAW like Logic, a tool like Live, a visual coding language like Max or a procedural language like JavaScript.

I believe that millions of brilliant voices are not realizing their full potential because their digital tooling enforces paradigms that ultimately stifle creativity more than they enable it. Functional programming provides musicians with a new set of tools and ideas with which they can make radically new work.

## The journey ahead

Over the next few lessons, we'll go over rhythms, functors, chords, products, improvisation, co-ends, mysticism and dependent types (amongst other things). The goal will be to use music to strengthen our intuition about functional programming and to use functional programming to strengthen our intuition about music.

During this journey, we will frequently make use of our fingers to type or edit code and our ears to listen. The basic interface, which you will see time and time again, is the editor pane. Go on, click **Start Audio** below and listen to the musical example.

In the example above, `c4` is a pitch representing middle-c on a piano. Try changing it to `d4`, then play it again and listen to the difference. What about `aFlat4`? `c5`?

In just a few lines of code, we can already arrive at rich and expressive musical textures.

If you've never worked with functional programming or with music before, don't worry. You just listened to an [isorhythmic pattern](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Isorhythm) with a _talea_ and _color_, and the code in the example uses a several powerful abstractions, including the [functor](https://pursuit.purescript.org/packages/purescript-prelude/5.0.1/docs/Data.Functor#t:Functor), the [profunctor](https://pursuit.purescript.org/packages/purescript-profunctor/5.0.0/docs/Data.Profunctor#t:Profunctor), and the [semigroupoid](https://pursuit.purescript.org/packages/purescript-prelude/5.0.1/docs/Control.Semigroupoid#t:Semigroupoid). We'll learn about what all these concepts mean and revisit some of them multiple times. The important thing to know is that one domain will always reinforce the other, stimulating our creativity and leading us to new territory as both musicians and programmers.
